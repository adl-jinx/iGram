# iGram
This is the first time using xCode and Swift, I tried to recreate an interface of Instagram.
Only the interface is replicated but is done using Apple Guidelines and their branding.

## Reimagined Instagram if it was made by Apple

I aimed to learn how interfaces works, best practices and at the same time Apple Guidelines. 
It was fun and short very beginner friendly.
